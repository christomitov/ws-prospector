# Docs Index

This folder is the source of truth for architecture and implementation intent.

## Start here

1. [Architecture](./architecture.md)
2. [Modules](./modules.md)
3. [Data Model](./data-model.md)
4. [Debugging](./debugging.md)
5. [Roadmap](./roadmap.md)

## Working agreement

- Update these docs whenever behavior, module contracts, or data shapes change.
- Keep implementation and docs in sync within the same commit.
- If docs lag behind code, prioritize doc fixes immediately.
